# gmail-pop-refresher
You use Gmail on desktop as a POP client, and you want to control the email fetching frequency. This extension clicks the button on the Accounts page to fetch mail.

To make it work, go to the accounts page : https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/accounts
You will see "Checking mail..." every 10 seconds.

You need to leave the page open in a tab for the refresh to work.
